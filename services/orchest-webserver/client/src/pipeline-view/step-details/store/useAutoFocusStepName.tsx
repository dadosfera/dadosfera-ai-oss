 * Step name field in StepDetails should be auto-focused ONLY when creating a new step.

 * 1. Click the step
 * 2. Click somewhere in StepDetails, to remove the focus on the Step Name field.
 * 3. Press "Delete" to delete the step.
 * Normally, we would autofocus the first field in a form to enhance UX, but not for this specific case.
 * Pulling this state out to its own store, so that  we won't accidentally change it back to always auto-focus.
